Ever since I was first introduced to coding, it seemed like the perfect thing for me. Something that allows you to exercise both your creativity with your analytical mind is  rare find- and coding seemed to be a harmonious integration of the two. Since I was young, I would do logic puzzles and sudoku many hours a day for fun, and I also loved creating things. I finally found a field that allowed me to do something I feel as more of a hobby or game, than like I'm doing work. Furthermore, the endless possibility of things you can create with programming allows so much room for creativity. Coding feels like solving a big puzzle, and it's addicting. 

Coding seems like a natural human ability- it's an innate human tendency to want to solve problems. We don't like to leave things unsolved. The confidence developed in programming can help develop a positive capable outlook on life- where you can see all problems as something that you can work on to resolve. The positive problem solving technique you use when coding, I feel isn't so different than how one goes through life. 

In programming, it's almost like you have to put yourself in the shoes of the code you're writing, to analyze what's happening in your code and how your variables and methods are interacting with each other. You put yourself in many different perspectives, which I feel like this comes from humans' natural ability to put themselves in and understand the perspective of others.
