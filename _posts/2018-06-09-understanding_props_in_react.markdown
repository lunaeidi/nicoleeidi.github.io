Something I struggled with learning about code was the props was what they represented in non-React code. I was struggling with finding something to compare them to, to grasp the concept. I came to the conclusion that there isn't really any other programming concept that they are analogous to, and it was an abstract concept I needed to create a new place in my mind for. The way I started to understand props now was the carrier of attributes from one component to another. They could be thought of as a storage case that carries the attributes from one state to another.
