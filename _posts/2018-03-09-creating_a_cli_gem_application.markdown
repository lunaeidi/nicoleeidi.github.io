Creating my first CLI gem application from scratch was both very enjoyable and a great learning process. I got to master all the details of how to run files, how to link files within the project, how to make files executable, navigating through the files system from the command line, and how to push all of my changes to GitHub. I was doing parts of these things before, but never had to do them from scratch and set up and organize everything myself. I was fascinated as I really learned the ins and outs of what's going on in the backbone of an application. 

Creating my CLI application was the most enjoyable and engaging coding experience I've had so far, as I got to create something all from scratch, planning every step of the way and allowing for a lot of creativity. It really showed me the excitement of programming and gave me a lot of motivation and creative ideas for programs I wanted to create.  

I ran into an interesting problem with the website I scraped from. Just two days after finishing my project, it no longer worked! I was getting the "403 Forbidden" error and realized that the website was blocking scraping with open-uri. I managed to get around this by changing User-Agent to that of a regular browser to trick the site as if my scraping attempts were a regular visit to the site. I then tested my application again and was happy when I noticed it was working again, although I noticed another strange error: it wasn't returning all of the states when I would select "all." I realized the site must have changed their HTML. What a timing for them to restructure their whole site! It was a quick fix though. From this I learned that scraping isn't such a reliable tool.
