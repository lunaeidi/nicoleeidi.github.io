When working with Rails, sometimes it's easier or more helpful for us to  create an HTML form rather than using the Rails form helper method. If you try to create a regular HTML form, you will get an error "Invalid Authenticity Token." This happens because Rails automatically requires all forms to have authenticity tokens. the Rails form_for and form_tag helpers provide the authenticity token behind the scenes. To include the token in your standard HTML form, you might think you can just copy the token  seen in the HTML generated by the Rails form helper method, as seen in the developer tools. This is a dangerous mistake though because it will seem to work just fine, when you test out your app on your computer. You won't know that this doesn't work until you test out your app from another computer, where you will see the "Invalid Authenticity Token" error. This is one example of why it's very important to test your app from not only your own computer. The proper way of integrating an authenticity token into your standard HTML form is: 

<input type="hidden" name="authenticity_token" value="<%= form_authenticity_token %>">

This will allow Rails to generate the token for you.
