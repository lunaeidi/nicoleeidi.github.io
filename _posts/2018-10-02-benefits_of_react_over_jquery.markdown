jQuery is perfect for small projects, but when the number of event listeners you're writing starts piling up, and  you start throwing on so many ids on your elements that you can't keep track of them, you might be wondering if there's a cleaner more concise way. This is where React's true power comes in. With an app that has too many event handlers and ids to keep track of, this could cause unexpected and unwanted buggy behavior of your event handlers affecting the other elements than what was intended. React is a declarative language, which means that you tell it how you want something to look, and it takes care of the "how". You don't need to do DOM manipulation, such as event handlers, yourself. React's components also provide for a lot of reusability. You can make use of the a component's state to affect many variables at once for example, if each of those variables depended on the state. In jQuery, if you wanted to change something about many different variables, you'd probably have to make changes in multiple lines of code instead of one.
