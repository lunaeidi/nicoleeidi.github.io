The Sinatra project is when I really dove into web development. It's where I saw how everything comes together, all the individual skills I've learned up to this point came together to produce a real-life web application. This really taught me how the HTML files, Ruby classes, and server-side framework code files interact to produce a working web application.

This project also pushed me to learn new programming skills, including retrieving images from the form params and presenting them on the show page, and building an auto-generated google maps iframe. These are only two of the many features I was excited to learn how to build, such as a messaging system between users, when planning out my program. I'll save the rest for another time. 

I found it really interesting to add the security features for my application, such as not letting users edit other users' listings. This led me to think from a hacker's mind to block different approaches they might use and expanded how I think about programming. Of course not providing the link on the show page to edit a listing for people other than the original poster wouldn't be enough. I had to ensure that the user_id of the room matched the id of the current_user,  because anyone with any knowledge in web development would think to try the '/edit' route and would still be able to access the edit form if this wasn't done. 

Apart from needing to think like a hacker, this project also made me think from a user's point of view to build what they would want to see and what  links and features would be helpful for them to use my site. This is one reason I love programming, it makes you think from many different perspectives and step outside of your own mind. This is a good training for dealing for real life too, helping you consider others' perspectives and to think outside the box of your own perspective.
