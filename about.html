<p>A solution seeking, full stack web developer with a passion for finding creative and logical resolutions to complex problems. With my lifelong pastime being Sudoku and logic puzzles, I knew coding would be something I would really enjoy. With my background in logic puzzles and as a writer and artist, I found something that combines my two passions. I love discovering how diverse applications that further integrate my passions  can be created with code. Coding is the creatorâ€™s tool that allows my ideas come to life.</p>
